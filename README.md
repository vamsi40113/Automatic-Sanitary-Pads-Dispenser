<b>In this project contributed members are @Charan-317(Chevuri Charan Teja), Gogu kalyan, Pulivarthi Purneshwara  Rao</b><br>
The user will show the College ID Card and the sanitary napkin to the user should be given automatically. No more embarrassment of asking for napkin from institution authorities.

<b>Why do we want to solve ?</b> <br>
In 2017 I saw an article that one girl pursuing her 10th or 9th class , she got her first period during class hour and her teacher ashamed her and called her dirty" due to ashamed in class room Infront of all classmates. She committed suicide. 
Many women in the world due to lack of money are using cotton clothes and getting infected, so to solve this problems I have designed free sanitary pads dispenser vending machine.
<br>

<b>How do we want to solve ?</b><br>
We want to implement a machine which detects identity through RFID .
When a person/women comes near to the machine and scans the RFID then through identification they will be provided a sanitary pad.
We want to implement in such a way the machine asks for a optional like if you wants to donates the for the women in need. They will be followed upto donation box and get their respective sanitary pad and we want to use that donation money for the women in needy and who cant afford for a sanitary pads. 
<br>

<b>IDEA APPROACH </b><br>
The module consists spring having napkins in between. By RFID, college id card is detected and The spring revolve for some time and nepkin is released also if user wants to donate money, They can drop 5rs coin to get napkin(optional).
